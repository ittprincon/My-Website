       <strong> Hello! </strong> My name is Ivan Rincon. I was born and raised in the great 
       city of Houston Texas! I spent the first six years of my life living in the city's 2nd 
       ward neighborhood but my parents moved us to Pearland so that we would have better opportunities
       as it related to our education and our social lives. I spent my adolescence like many others playing
       with friends, playing, sports videogames.

        I am a recent graduate from the University of Houston.
            I graduated with a degree in Management Information systems. Over the course of my 
            studies I obtained a very small foundation of a technical background.</p>
    <h4>Some of my skills include</h4> <img src = https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/960x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblogs-images.forbes.com%2Fforbestechcouncil%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F01%2Fcanva-photo-editor-8-7.jpg>

    </ul>
    <p> 
            I am currently employed with Talent Path. Here, I am attempting to close the gap in my 
            skills so that i may become "industry ready". So far we have learnd a lot about soft 
            skills and professionalism. This week we began learning about Javascript and HTML. I 
            also had a little introduction into Python, and although i am unfamiliar with the language
            I was able to follow the logic.
